## Welcome to My Research Portfolio

This page highlights a curated selection of my research projects spanning **artificial intelligence, medical imaging, computational psychiatry, and multi-modal omics integration**. 

You will find work in the following domains:

- **Medical Imaging & AI:** 3D GAN-based segmentation pipelines for prostate MRI and multi-modal volumetric analysis.
- **Neuropsychiatric Biomarkers:** Multi-modal studies linking **transcriptomics, functional MRI, and iPSC-derived neuron models** to disorders such as Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and schizophrenia.
- **Computational Genomics & Multi-Omics:** Integration of RNA-seq, GWAS, and functional brain imaging data to derive precision biomarkers for psychiatric disorders.
- **High-Performance Computing & Machine Learning:** Distributed deep learning pipelines for large-scale biomedical datasets, enabling reproducible research.
