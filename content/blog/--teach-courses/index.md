[HugoBlox Kit](https://hugoblox.com) is designed to give technical content creators a seamless experience. You can focus on the content and the HugoBlox Kit which this template is built upon handles the rest.

**Embed videos, podcasts, code, LaTeX math, and even test students!**

On this page, you'll find some examples of the types of technical content that can be rendered with Hugo Blox.

## Citation

Here's an example of citing a publication using the cite shortcode:

{{< cite page="/publications/preprint" view="citation" >}}

You can also use the default view by omitting the view parameter:

{{< cite page="/publications/conference-paper" >}}
