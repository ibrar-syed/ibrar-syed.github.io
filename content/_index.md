      title: '📚 My Research'
      subtitle: ''
      text: |-
        I specialize in applying advanced artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning techniques to complex problems in medical imaging, radiomics, and computational fluid dynamics. My research focuses on developing and evaluating novel deep learning architectures—including U-Net, E-Net, GANs, transformer models, and diffusion models—for automated segmentation and analysis of prostate MRI datasets and other biomedical imaging applications.

        I also investigate nanofluid dynamics, mixed convection, and variable viscosity effects, exploring the thermal and transport properties of hybrid nanoparticles in fluids to enhance heat transfer and material conductivity.

        My work integrates quantitative image analysis, radiomics, and advanced modeling to improve diagnostic accuracy, clinical decision-making, and personalized healthcare strategies. I evaluate the clinical applicability of generative AI and deep learning models in medical imaging workflows, focusing on accurate segmentation, predictive modeling, and radiomics feature extraction.

        I am always open to collaborations and interdisciplinary projects at the intersection of AI, medical imaging, computational modeling, and applied physics. Let’s connect to explore innovative solutions! 😃
