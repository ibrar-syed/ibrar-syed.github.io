## Project Overview

This project leverages state-of-the-art deep learning techniques to classify multiple types of skin lesions from the ISIC2018 dataset. The model is trained to detect and categorize skin cancer types accurately, with a focus on robustness and real-world applicability.

## Features

- Multi-class skin lesion classification
- Data augmentation and preprocessing for improved generalization
- Model evaluation with precision, recall, and F1-score
- User-friendly visualization of predictions
