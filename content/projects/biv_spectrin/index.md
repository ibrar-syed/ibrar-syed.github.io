## Project Overview

Schizophrenia (SCZ) is a severe neuropsychiatric disorder characterized by complex molecular, cellular, and functional brain abnormalities. Growing evidence indicates that **functional and molecular dysregulation precede overt structural brain changes**, motivating the development of biologically grounded, multimodal biomarkers.

This project integrates **transcriptomics (RNA-seq), imaging genomics, and iPSC-derived neuronal models** to characterize **βIV spectrin (SPTBN4)** and **AKT/GSK3 signaling pathway dysregulation** as convergent biomarkers of schizophrenia. By linking gene expression changes to cellular phenotypes and systems-level imaging features, the study provides a mechanistic and reproducible biomarker framework relevant for precision psychiatry.

## 🔑 Key Scientific Insights

- **βIV spectrin reduction is a reproducible molecular signature of schizophrenia**, observed in postmortem dorsolateral prefrontal cortex tissue and cellular models.
- **AKT/GSK3 signaling directly regulates βIV spectrin stability**, linking intracellular kinase dysregulation to neuronal cytoskeletal integrity.
- **Transcriptomic co-expression analyses (PsychENCODE RNA-seq)** reveal coordinated dysregulation of *SPTBN4* and AKT/GSK3 pathway genes.
- **iPSC-derived neurons from high-genetic-risk individuals recapitulate disease-associated molecular phenotypes**, supporting causal relevance.
- **Machine learning models integrating transcriptomic and imaging features achieve high classification accuracy (>95%)**, highlighting translational potential.
- **Multi-omics convergence enhances biological interpretability**, outperforming single-modality biomarkers.

- Differential gene expression analysis in schizophrenia-relevant cortical regions
- Gene co-expression network analysis linking cytoskeletal regulation with intracellular signaling
- Pathway enrichment (GO / KEGG) implicating synaptic function, neuronal stability, and signal transduction
- Integration of transcriptomic gradients with imaging and cellular phenotypes
