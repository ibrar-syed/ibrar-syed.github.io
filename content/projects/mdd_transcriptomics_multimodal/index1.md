## Project Overview

Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is a severe psychiatric condition with complex functional and molecular mechanisms. Traditional structural imaging biomarkers have limited reproducibility and sensitivity — functional biomarkers like **regional homogeneity (ReHo)** demonstrate much stronger effects in large cohort studies. This project adopts a **transcriptomics-driven multi-modal framework** to link **RNA-seq–derived gene expression signatures** to functional neuroimaging patterns in MDD.

## 🔑 Key Scientific Insights (Summary)

- **Functional brain alterations outperform structural markers in MDD:**  
  Regional homogeneity (ReHo)–based functional MRI deficits show **2–3× larger effect sizes** than cortical thickness reductions, indicating that Major Depressive Disorder is characterized primarily by **functional dysregulation rather than structural atrophy**.

- **Robust and reproducible hypoperfusion signature:**  
  ReHo deficits strongly co-localize with **regionally specific reductions in cerebral blood flow (RCBF)**, revealing a highly reproducible pattern of **cortical hypoperfusion** across large, independent cohorts.

- **Regional Vulnerability Index (RVI) as a powerful biomarker:**  
  A ReHo-derived **functional Regional Vulnerability Index (RVI-MDD)** demonstrates stronger and more consistent effect sizes than any single brain region alone and clearly outperforms structural RVI measures.

- **Cross-dataset validation at unprecedented scale:**  
  Findings were validated across **15,501 participants** from multiple large-scale datasets, including UK Biobank, ENIGMA, Amish Connectome Project, and independent clinical cohorts, confirming robustness and generalizability.

- **Biological grounding via multimodal integration:**  
  The convergence of ReHo, RCBF, and transcriptomic associations suggests that **functional MRI–based biomarkers reflect underlying molecular and vascular mechanisms**, strengthening their relevance for computational psychiatry and precision medicine.

- **Overall Interpretation:**  
These results support **ReHo-based functional vulnerability patterns** as a novel, biologically grounded, and highly sensitive biomarker framework for studying Major Depressive Disorder, with direct implications for transcriptomics-informed neuropsychiatric modeling.

## 🧬 Transcriptomics & Molecular Integration

Brain-region–specific **transcriptomic profiles (RNA-sequencing data)** are mapped to imaging phenotypes to uncover key molecular pathways associated with MDD. The emphasis on RNA-seq and gene expression analysis provides high-value biological insight beyond imaging alone:

- High-resolution gene expression profiling of brain regions showing functional deficits
- Differential expression of synaptic, inflammatory, and neurovascular genes
- Pathway enrichment (GO/KEGG) analysis tied to neural activity alterations
- Integration of transcriptomic gradients with functional cortical maps for mechanistic interpretation

This approach positions the project at the intersection of **transcriptomics, neuroimaging, and psychiatric genomics**, attractive to researchers in multi-omics, systems biology, and mental health.

## 🔬 Functional Neuroimaging Biomarkers

- **Regional Homogeneity (ReHo):** A voxel-based measure of local synchrony in resting-state fMRI.
- **Regional Cerebral Blood Flow (RCBF):** Perfusion measures linked to ReHo deficits.
- Functional deficits in MDD show larger effect sizes compared to structural changes (cortical thickness) across major cohorts. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

This schematic demonstrates:
1. RNA-seq and transcriptomic processing  
2. Functional MRI preprocessing and ReHo calculation  
3. Linking gene expression gradients with functional deficits  
4. Building machine learning models for biomarker prediction

It provides **biologically interpretable, cross-modal biomarkers** for MDD with relevance for diagnostics, stratification, and personalized interventions.
