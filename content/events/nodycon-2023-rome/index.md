summary: "Oral presentation on hydrogen in conductors with copper and silver nanoparticles, analyzing mixed convection and variable viscosity effects."

abstract: |
**Abstract:**
  This chapter presents an analysis of the influence of mixed convection and variable viscosity under the impact of a transverse magnetic field on a stretching surface. Nanofluid viscidness is supposed to be reliant on temperature. The influence of variable viscidity on the transversal magnetic field and hybrid convection can be seen by using Reynold’s model.

  The resulting nonlinear system of partial differential equations is transmuted into a nonlinear system of first-order ordinary differential equations by the Lobatto IIIA approach, simplifying physical flow problems.

  The numerical results obtained in this study are validated and illustrated with figures and tables and hence are very well in line with previous literature findings.

  This research has helped minimize the fluid flow and upsurges the fluid temperature and associated thermal boundary thickness by increasing the amount of Hartmann. In addition, the effect of the mixed convection and applied magnetics transverse field is studied.
