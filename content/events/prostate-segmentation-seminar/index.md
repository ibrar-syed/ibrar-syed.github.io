summary: "Invited seminar on advanced deep learning methods for prostate segmentation, highlighting clinical relevance of generative AI models and radiomics applications."

abstract: |
  **Abstract:**
  
  This seminar explores the application of **advanced deep learning approaches** for **accurate prostate segmentation** using **T2-weighted MRI datasets** of prostate cancer patients. The study emphasizes both methodological innovation and clinical relevance in radiomics workflows.
  
  Multiple architectures are employed and compared, including **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**, **Transformer-based models**, **Diffusion models**, **U-Net**, **E-Net**, and **ERF-Nets**. The seminar demonstrates how these models improve segmentation accuracy, enhance tissue boundary detection, and enable reliable extraction of radiomic features for downstream clinical applications.
  
  Attendees will gain insights into:
  - Preprocessing and augmentation of T2-weighted MRI prostate datasets
  - Training and evaluation of GANs, Transformers, Diffusion, and CNN-based segmentation models
  - Integration of segmentation results into radiomic analysis pipelines for prostate cancer characterization
  - Challenges and opportunities for generative AI in clinical imaging
